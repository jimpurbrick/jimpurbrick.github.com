        </div>
        
        <div><p>Several years ago when we were in <a href="http://100robots.com/">100 robots</a> together, <a href="https://twitter.com/toastkid">Max</a> was celebrating his 40th birthday. When I said that mine would be in 2017, it felt like an impossibly far future date, but, after what feels like the blink of an eye, here we&nbsp;are.</p>
<p>Along with many other lovely gifts I received this morning was a book with the subtitle <a href="http://www.harpercollins.ca/9780008185329/now-we-are-40">Whatever happened to Generation X? by Tiffanie Darke</a> complete with a bright yellow acid house cover and a quote by Douglas Coupland on the&nbsp;cover.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll read the book when I go to Simon and Pinar&#8217;s wedding next month, but I&#8217;ll share my immediate reaction now. Despite the term being popularised by <a href="https://www.coupland.com/books/generation-x-tales-for-an-accelerated-culture">Coupland&#8217;s book</a>, whatever did happen to generation X we won&#8217;t read it in a book. We&#8217;ll read and write about it on the web we&nbsp;built.</p>
<p>While I remember my parents freaking out when I wanted to wear a bright yellow acid house badge to school, at the time I was more in to loud guitar music like <a href="http://www.nirvana.com/">Nirvana</a> and <a href="http://www.blur.co.uk/">Blur</a>. From the perspective of loud guitars it did feel a bit like I&#8217;d missed the party, with Metalica&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Puppets">Master of Puppets</a> already receading in to the rear view mirror and <a href="http://www.ledzeppelin.com/">Led Zeppelin</a> firmly in my parents era, but while we didn&#8217;t have <a href="www.thebeatles.com">The Beatles</a>, I did have computers and&nbsp;networks.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people who would argue that I missed the boat there too: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">Boolean algebra</a> was developed in 1848; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting Problem</a> proved to be undecidable over Turing machines in 1936 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Quicksort</a> was developed in 1959. While the <a href="http://fbinfer.com/">Infer</a> team refused to give up at the halting problem and are now producing amazing real world results using static analysis a lot of computer science was finished before I was&nbsp;born.</p>
<p>My kind of computers weren&#8217;t huge machines crunching numbers and doing maths though, they were small pieces loosely joined. Connecting to things and each other they didn&#8217;t operate on maths, but changed the world or built new ones. They automated my physics experiment in to different of configurations of springs in a reverb unit so that I could spend more time kissing Ali in the common room, they helped reverse engineer Grand Theft Auto maps and build new ones and <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/014892600559155#.WPlHtVPyvdQ">automated synthesiser parameters</a> when I didn&#8217;t have real controls for&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>They let me record <a href="https://storybird.bandcamp.com/releases">hours</a> of <a href="https://pointmass.bandcamp.com/">music</a> and made writing books, making films and recording music accessible to everyone and provided a platform for everyone to share what they made. While that made lives harder for those trying to make a living from their art it helped many more lives flourish. The <a href="http://www.rollingstones.com/">Rolling Stones</a> were forced to become a touring animatronic version of thier former selves when they couldn&#8217;t sell CDs, but the french horn player from my school could plunder the past for <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/6754-Artemis">funk loops to accompany his synthesisers</a>.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">DIY</span> explosion gave us hip-hop and a million flavours of dance music and the networks to share it. Eventually it also gave us digital versions of the Beatles and, now I have been able to download and listen to it all, I&#8217;m convinced they have nothing to top the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdZs5PVcwBs">Aphex Twin</a>.</p>
<p>Climate change may mean that our real world horizons are closer and the piles of stuff we collect smaller, but the virtual vistas we can explore are vast and ever&nbsp;growing.</p>
<p>When I watch my children grow up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> it&#8217;s amazing to think about what they will accomplish in the future. If they want to do something, they watch it, learn it and do it. Nothing is unknown and nothing is impossible. They&#8217;re incredible, which is lucky, as together we&#8217;re going to have to save the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>These thoughts are my own. They don&#8217;t represent my employer. They don&#8217;t attempt to speak for my generation. I write them and share them because I can and because I want to. Someone might read them and comment on them or link to them to build a web. Thats how my generation works and that&#8217;s what we built. We may not have had the Beatles, but I&#8217;m <span class="caps">OK</span> with&nbsp;that.</p></div>
